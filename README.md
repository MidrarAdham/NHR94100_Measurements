## SCPI_Queries.py:

This file is set to send a set of queries to the Grid Simulator (NHR 9410) and save the responses to a csv file. Each query is saved in a variable called 
```output#```. The command ```time.sleep(#)``` is an arbitrary time resolution. Change ```#``` to a number that fits your application.
